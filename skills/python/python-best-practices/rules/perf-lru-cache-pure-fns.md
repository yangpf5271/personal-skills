## Use `functools.lru_cache` for Pure Functions

When a function is pure (same input → same output, no side effects) and called repeatedly with the same arguments, `@lru_cache` caches the result so subsequent calls are free. Agents often forget this exists and either hand-roll a dict cache or eat the recomputation cost.

**Incorrect (recomputing the same answer):**

```python
def parse_version(version_str: str) -> Version:
    # called from many call sites, often with the same string
    return Version.parse(version_str)
```

If 100 call sites ask `parse_version("1.2.3")`, you parse it 100 times.

**Correct (cached):**

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=256)
def parse_version(version_str: str) -> Version:
    return Version.parse(version_str)
```

First call parses and stores; subsequent calls return the cached `Version`. `maxsize` caps the cache to 256 entries (LRU eviction).

**`functools.cache` (Python 3.9+) for unbounded:**

```python
from functools import cache

@cache
def build_schema(spec: SchemaSpec) -> Schema:
    return Schema.compile(spec)          # spec fully determines the result
```

No size limit. Good when the key space is naturally small and entries are expensive to build. **The key must capture every input that influences the result:** a `load_schema(name)` that reads `SCHEMA_DIR / name` from disk caches the file's *contents* under a key that doesn't include them — it returns stale data forever if the file changes. Reading state that isn't in the arguments makes the function impure, and caching it freezes that state.

**Requirements:**

- Arguments must be **hashable** (no mutable lists, dicts, or sets as args)
- Function must be **pure** — same inputs produce the same output
- No side effects that callers depend on happening each call

**When NOT to cache:**

- Arguments are unhashable (convert to tuple first, or use a different strategy)
- The function has meaningful side effects (logging, writes)
- The key space is unbounded and entries are large (cache grows without limit)
- The computation is cheap and the call frequency is low
- Callers may mutate the returned object — the cache hands every caller the same instance, so one caller's mutation becomes everyone's
- Concurrent first calls must not duplicate work — these decorators don't lock; racing misses all execute

**Hand-rolled caches:**

If `@lru_cache` doesn't fit (unhashable args, multi-level keys, time-based invalidation), build a module-level `dict` cache — but name it clearly and document the invalidation strategy. Uncontrolled hand-rolled caches leak memory.

**Watch instance retention on cached methods:** on an instance method, the cache key includes `self`, so the cache holds a strong reference to every instance it has seen — released only on eviction or `cache_clear()`. A bounded LRU retains up to `maxsize` instances; `@cache` / `maxsize=None` retains all of them for the life of the process. When the value depends only on `self`, `@cached_property` (see `simplify-cached-property`) stores the result on the instance instead, so it's collected with the instance.
